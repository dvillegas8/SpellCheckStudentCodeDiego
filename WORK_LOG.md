Also, decided to try using binary search to solve this puzzle. I am currently working on implementing that. |

| September 25 | 10:50- 11:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Finished the rest of the code (like finding duplicates and converting Array List to array). However, I found that I keep getting an out of bounds error so I need to fix that. |
| September 26 |  7:30 - 9:00  | Fixed all the out of bounds errors by moving the removing duplicates code after we have found all of the misspelled words. I keep returning words that are spelled correctly, so I did a bunch of debugging by using print statements. First, I found out that I was using the wrong string method. I was using indexOf instead of charAt in order to compare letters. Additionally, I found that my code fails in the case where the word at mid and the current word start with the same letter. |

However, my code doesn't return the correct number of misspelled words. I think it may be because of my insert function and which nodes im setting to true, so I need to debug that. |

I need to check if the last character of the string is a word (check if isWord is true or false) |

Finished the normal Trie by making it so that misspelled words is tracked with a Trie. |

| October 6    |  4:30 - 6:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tried approaching the insert method recursively, however that didn't work. Tried approaching insert using a for loop and that didn't work. It created my Trie incorrectly and when I fixed it, I kept getting out of bounds errors. Unfortunately, I don't have time to finish this. |
