Also, decided to try using binary search to solve this puzzle. I am currently working on implementing that. |

However, I found that I keep getting an out of bounds error so I need to fix that. |
| September 26 |  7:30 - 9:00  | Fixed all the out of bounds errors by moving the removing duplicates code after we have found all of the misspelled words. I keep returning words that are spelled correctly, so I did a bunch of debugging by using print statements. First, I found out that I was using the wrong string method. I was using indexOf instead of charAt in order to compare letters. Additionally, I found that my code fails in the case where the word at mid and the current word start with the same letter. |

However, my code doesn't return the correct number of misspelled words. I think it may be because of my insert function and which nodes im setting to true, so I need to debug that. |
